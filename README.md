📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The objective of this project is to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE based on their textual content.

This solution is particularly important in today's world where misinformation can spread quickly through digital media. By leveraging data science tools, this project contributes towards automatic and efficient identification of fake news.

🔍 Features
Data preprocessing & cleaning

Text vectorization using TF-IDF

Model training using Passive Aggressive Classifier

Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation

User-friendly notebook walkthrough

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes labeled news articles, marked as either REAL or FAKE. The dataset typically contains the following columns:

title: Title of the news article

text: Full text of the news article

label: Ground truth label (FAKE/REAL)

Note: You can use datasets such as the Fake and real news dataset from Kaggle.

🧪 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – Data handling

sklearn – ML modeling & evaluation

TfidfVectorizer – Text feature extraction

PassiveAggressiveClassifier – Classification algorithm

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

📈 Model
The classifier used is Passive Aggressive Classifier, which is particularly well-suited for online learning with streaming data. It updates its model only when the prediction is incorrect, making it efficient and fast.

📌 Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1 Score (can be extended)
